Our Hero is a skilled warrior cat with a red band and his name is Lee. There is two different levels: while the first one is based on the player exploration on the cave, the second one represents the exit of this dangerous place where the player has to escape from. Lee will have to reach the end of the levels avoiding enemies which will start chasing him. Besides, Lee can collect coins that he finds into the levels.
