Final Fantasy: Mystery World is a dungeon crawler RPG with micro-turn-based combat, where players follow the main story branch to rescue their kidnapped friend from the clutches of a mysterious monster in the Final Fantasy universe. Along the journey, players must also help the villagers trapped in this strange world.

I took on the role of Team Lead, coordinating the team's workflow, managing task distribution, and ensuring smooth collaboration. In addition to leading the team, I also contributed significantly as a core programmer, working on game systems, combat logic, and overall structure.
