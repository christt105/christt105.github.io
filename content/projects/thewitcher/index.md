The Witcher: A Bard’s Tale is a cooperative action game developed by 37 students from the Bachelor’s Degree in Video Game Design and Development at Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC). This project was created over the course of three months as part of the subject “Project 3,” with the goal of simulating the workflow of a real indie studio. Developed entirely using our own custom engine, the team was divided into design, programming, and art departments, working together to bring a complete game experience to life. I focused on programming, rotating between gameplay and engine development throughout the project.
