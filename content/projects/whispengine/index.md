Whisp Engine is a custom 3D game engine developed from scratch using OpenGL and SDL, featuring a basic Lua scripting system and a Unity-inspired entity-component architecture. It was created over the course of three months as part of the Game Engines subject in the third year of the Videogame Development degree at CITM-UPC.
