Andro Dunos Remake is a side-scrolling shoot 'em up inspired by the classic arcade game Andro Dunos. It was my first game project, developed entirely from scratch in C++ using SDL. Built as a team effort, I took the role of lead programmer, responsible for core systems such as rendering, input, collision, and enemy behavior. The game includes multiple levels, enemy waves, and basic power-up mechanics, aiming to replicate the fast-paced feel of early 90s arcade shooters.
