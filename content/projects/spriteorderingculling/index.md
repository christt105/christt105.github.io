This project is part of the second-year course *Project 2* at CITM-UPC, supervised by lecturer Ricard Pillosu.

The research focuses on optimizing 2D games by implementing **camera culling**, which means only rendering sprites visible inside the camera viewport, improving performance. It also explores **sprite ordering techniques** to create a convincing sense of depth in **top-down** and **isometric** games. The project includes integration of the **Tiled map editor** with **SDL**.

Performance analysis using **Brofiler** can be found in the repository, demonstrating the impact of camera culling on rendering efficiency.
