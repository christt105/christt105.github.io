Hi! I'm a **programmer passionate about technology**, games, and tools. I mainly work with **C# and Unity** professionally, and for personal projects, I use **Godot and C++**. I love working on my own projects, building custom tools like a game engine and a 3D tile map editor.

Currently, Iâ€™m part of the industry creating software for architecture and IoT, at Nurogames, among other areas. You can learn more about my professional background in the [experience section](resume).

I really enjoy **sharing knowledge** and **continuously learning** new things. Feel free to explore some of my [projects](projects) or read my posts on my [blog](blog).
