title: "About me"
---

Hello! I'm a programmer who loves making games and tools, but I'm interested in many other things too. Right now, I mainly use C#, but I've spent a lot of time with C/C++ over the years. I also work with JavaScript, Python, Dart, and Flutter. Professionally, I'm focused on Unity, but I also have experience with OpenGL and lower-level libraries in C++. For my personal projects, I've been using Godot for a while.

I'm currently working at Nurogames, where I create software for architecture and IoT. My job involves building programs in Unity that handle BIM files.

I've always been fascinated by programming tools, which is why my two main personal projects are a game engine and a 3D tile map editor, both built from scratch with C++ and OpenGL.
