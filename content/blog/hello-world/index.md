Hello everyone, welcome to my blog.

I’ve been thinking about starting a blog for quite some time now. My main goal is to share the progress I’m making on my projects, some of which I haven’t made public yet. That said, I’m also open to writing posts about new things I discover in the tech world, or who knows, maybe I'll feel like sharing thoughts on movies, series, and video games I’m currently enjoying.

After giving it some thought, I decided to build the blog with Hugo. This is my first time using it, so let’s see how it goes. I’m using the *Stack* theme, which you can find referenced in the footer, though I’ve tweaked it a bit to make it look more like my personal website. I also kept the light mode active for that part of society that prefers it.

The idea is to make all posts available in the three languages I speak: Spanish, Catalan, and English. Let’s see if it isn’t too challenging to manage the blog in all three languages.

Comments are completely open to anyone who’d like to discuss anything.
