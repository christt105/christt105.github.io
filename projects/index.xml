&lt;p>The research focuses on optimizing 2D games by implementing &lt;strong>camera culling&lt;/strong>, which means only rendering sprites visible inside the camera viewport, improving performance. It also explores &lt;strong>sprite ordering techniques&lt;/strong> to create a convincing sense of depth in &lt;strong>top-down&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>isometric&lt;/strong> games. The project includes integration of the &lt;strong>Tiled map editor&lt;/strong> with &lt;strong>SDL&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Performance analysis using &lt;strong>Brofiler&lt;/strong> can be found in the repository, demonstrating the impact of camera culling on rendering efficiency.&lt;/p>
