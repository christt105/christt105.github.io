&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link" href="../media-tracker-origins" &gt;In the previous post&lt;/a&gt;, I explained all the tools I used before this one. This post is probably going to be the most extensive of the three. My goal is to explain everything I have configured, including all scripts and settings, in case anyone wants to replicate what I&amp;rsquo;ve done. My new solution uses two tools, but this one is the heart of my media tracker. Let&amp;rsquo;s get into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-new-solution"&gt;The New Solution
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For my new Media Tracker, I wanted to keep several points in mind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All my data must belong to me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to migrate data to another application if necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accessible from any device. Being able to add, delete, and edit any data, mainly from my phone, but also accessible from my computer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to add comments, images, and videos to each element.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having a website that is easily accessible from any device and completely adaptable to my needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to add movies, series, and games in the same database comfortably.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some research, I decided to go with &lt;a class="link" href="https://obsidian.md/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
 &gt;Obsidian&lt;/a&gt; for creating and editing each element of the tracker. Due to Obsidian&amp;rsquo;s nature with Markdown, and my experience building my website and blog with &lt;a class="link" href="https://gohugo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
 &gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;, I decided to use it to generate my media tracker&amp;rsquo;s website. Although we&amp;rsquo;ll talk about that in the next post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="obsidian"&gt;Obsidian
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those of you who know how &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.notion.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
 &gt;Notion&lt;/a&gt; works, you might have raised an eyebrow in the &lt;a class="link" href="../media-tracker-origins" &gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt; when I said that with Notion my data belonged to me; that isn&amp;rsquo;t true. In Notion, the data isn&amp;rsquo;t yours: they can revoke your access whenever they consider because they own it. So, it was time to make a move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From one obsession to another, &lt;a class="link" href="https://obsidian.md/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
 &gt;Obsidian&lt;/a&gt; came into my life. This tool is an application for taking notes in Markdown format. It allows you to create relationships between your notes to generate a graph. It is very similar to the structure of &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.wikipedia.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
 &gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, where you can browse through different pages via relational links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to my new acquisition, a mini PC, I could sync my notes very efficiently with &lt;a class="link" href="https://syncthing.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
 &gt;Syncthing&lt;/a&gt;, as I already explained in my other post &lt;a class="link" href="https://christt105.github.io/es/blog/six-months-with-my-first-home-server/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
 &gt;Six months with my first home server&lt;/a&gt;, which was the point that held me back the most from Obsidian. Now I&amp;rsquo;m going to explain how I have Obsidian configured for the Media Tracker. I might make a post in the future explaining how I have my entire Obsidian set up, as it seems like an incredible tool to integrate into your daily life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="template"&gt;Template
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t plan on doing it, but in the end, I created a template with all the necessary files to make it work exactly as I have it. Configuring it in an existing vault can be somewhat tedious; it should have been a plugin, but I built it on the fly and didn&amp;rsquo;t think many people would use it, as it&amp;rsquo;s all tailored to my specific needs. You can download the vault, open it with Obsidian, and check how everything is set up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/christt105/media-tracker-obsidian-template" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
 &gt;&lt;img src="https://christt105.github.io/media-tracker-obsidian-template_10322631758677978418.png"

		class="gallery-image" 
		data-flex-grow="200"
		data-flex-basis="480px"
	
&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it gets enough support, I might consider making a specific plugin for Obsidian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="organization"&gt;Organization
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I decided to keep the Media Tracker inside my main Obsidian &lt;em&gt;vault&lt;/em&gt;. The Media Tracker lives only in one folder; this way I prevent it from mixing with other notes and it&amp;rsquo;s easier to differentiate. Inside &lt;code&gt;Juegos/&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Movies/&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;TVs/&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;Seasons/&lt;/code&gt;, individual instances of games, movies, series, and seasons live respectively; each element has its own note. I also have a &lt;code&gt;Portadas/&lt;/code&gt; folder where I store cover images and banners for elements that aren&amp;rsquo;t on the web, especially for fangames.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://christt105.github.io/blog/media-tracker-obsidian/MediaTrackerFolders.png"
	width="348"

		alt="My Media Tracker folders inside Obsidian"
	
	
		class="gallery-image" 
		data-flex-grow="174"
		data-flex-basis="419px"
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;code&gt;Media Tracker/&lt;/code&gt;, there is the &lt;code&gt;Media Tracker Views.base&lt;/code&gt; file, which is a database-type file with several views. Bases are a very recent addition; they were implemented just as I started using Obsidian. It&amp;rsquo;s a file that allows you to visualize your notes in various ways, similar to Notion views. It has an API, so the community is already starting to use them for more complex things. For now, I&amp;rsquo;ve only created very basic views and I barely use them since I have the website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://christt105.github.io/blog/media-tracker-obsidian/MediaTrackerBaseAll.png"
	width="1513"

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="series-and-seasons"&gt;Series and Seasons
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had a problem with series. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what to do with shows that have multiple seasons. On one hand, there are series with several seasons that I watch at different times, so I should separate each one, but on the other hand, making a duplicate series note can look weird if there is only one season. It&amp;rsquo;s also true that some series organize seasons very poorly, which can get chaotic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s why I finally decided on a hybrid solution. Each series has its own note with the same properties as movies. If a series has only one season, the series note is used. If it has multiple seasons, a note is created for each season, and the date of the series note is updated to match the date of the last season watched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only downside is that I have to update two statuses and two dates for the same series (in the series note and in the last season&amp;rsquo;s note). I think it&amp;rsquo;s the most feasible solution to this problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="plugins-and-scripts"&gt;Plugins and Scripts
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most incredible things about Obsidian is the customization through community plugins. It opens up a giant field of possibilities. I&amp;rsquo;ve mainly used three plugins that have made the experience much better than the previous solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really could have created a plugin that encompassed everything, but since I went step by step and didn&amp;rsquo;t have much experience with Obsidian, I added plugins and scripts as I needed functionalities. Let me explain how I have everything working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="templater"&gt;Templater
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class="link" href="obsidian://show-plugin?id=templater-obsidian" &gt;Templater&lt;/a&gt; plugin works great for using templates, executing actions, and adding information when creating new notes. This helps us import information from movie, series, and game databases and organize the notes instantly upon creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="movie-search"&gt;Movie Search
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class="link" href="obsidian://show-plugin?id=movie-search" &gt;Movie Search&lt;/a&gt; plugin is a bit old but still works very well. There are a few things I would change, but for now, it&amp;rsquo;s more than enough. It adds a button that opens a panel to enter the movie or series name. When searching, it queries the TMDB API and shows you the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://christt105.github.io/blog/media-tracker-obsidian/MovieSearchPluginSearch.png"
	width="560"
	height="214"
	loading="lazy"
	
		alt="Movie Search Plugin panel to search for a movie or series"
	
	
		class="gallery-image" 
		data-flex-grow="261"
		data-flex-basis="628px"
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://christt105.github.io/blog/media-tracker-obsidian/MovieSearchPluginResults.png"
	width="709"
	height="733"
	loading="lazy"
	
		alt="Search results with Movie Search Plugin"
	
	
		class="gallery-image" 
		data-flex-grow="96"
		data-flex-basis="232px"
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When selecting an option, it creates a new note with a configured template, replaces variables with the corresponding values, and executes the Templater code. TMDB has two types (&lt;code&gt;movie&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;tv&lt;/code&gt;) which are added directly to the &lt;code&gt;type&lt;/code&gt; property. A default poster and banner are assigned using the image link, and the TMDB ID is stored for future reference. Genres and the synopsis are also saved, formatting them correctly since the plugin has issues if they include slashes or double quotes. It also checks if it&amp;rsquo;s a series and adds the &lt;code&gt;seasons&lt;/code&gt; property. Finally, it takes the year and modifies the filename to include it and avoid duplicates. The template I am currently using is this: &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/christt105/media-tracker-obsidian-template/blob/main/MediaTrackerTemplate%2FTemplates%2FMovie.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
 &gt;Movie.md&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this would be the final result of the note:
&lt;img src="https://christt105.github.io/blog/media-tracker-obsidian/MovieSearchPluginResultNote.png"
	width="1503"
	height="1028"
	loading="lazy"
	
		alt="Result of a note created with Movie Search Plugin"
	
	
		class="gallery-image" 
		data-flex-grow="146"
		data-flex-basis="350px"
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="quickadd"&gt;QuickAdd
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class="link" href="obsidian://show-plugin?id=quickadd" &gt;QuickAdd&lt;/a&gt; plugin allows you to create scripts and execute them via actions. This way, I can easily edit my notes by accessing external APIs. The scripts are in JavaScript; most are made with AI and subsequently edited by me. These are some of the functions I&amp;rsquo;ve created:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id="add-game"&gt;Add Game
&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;For video games, I decided to use the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.igdb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
 &gt;IGDB&lt;/a&gt; database. To use their API, you have to log in with Twitch, which is a bit weird. Gaming databases are behind movie databases: they are usually in English and the information is incomplete. I chose IGDB because it was the only one that included the fangames I&amp;rsquo;ve played.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used this script from &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/Elaws/script_videogames_quickAdd" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
 &gt;Elaws/script_videogames_quickAdd&lt;/a&gt; and modified it for my template &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/christt105/media-tracker-obsidian-template/blob/main/MediaTrackerTemplate%2FTemplates%2FIGDB.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
 &gt;IGDB.md&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/christt105/media-tracker-obsidian-template/blob/main/MediaTrackerTemplate%2FScripts%2FQuickAdd%2Figdb.js" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
 &gt;this script&lt;/a&gt;. The workflow is similar to the movie search: you enter the name and select the option to create the note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://christt105.github.io/blog/media-tracker-obsidian/NoteSilksong.png"

		class="gallery-image" 
		data-flex-grow="177"
		data-flex-basis="426px"
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id="create-season"&gt;Create Season
&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;I needed a button to create a Season note from a Series note, carrying over all attributes and references. I made &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/christt105/media-tracker-obsidian-template/blob/main/MediaTrackerTemplate%2FScripts%2FQuickAdd%2FcreateSeason.js" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
 &gt;this script&lt;/a&gt; that checks if you are in a series note, asks for the season number, and generates the note using &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/christt105/media-tracker-obsidian-template/blob/main/MediaTrackerTemplate%2FTemplates%2FSeason.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
 &gt;this template&lt;/a&gt;, adding &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot; - Season X&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; to the name. The new note copies the series images and links them via the &lt;code&gt;seasons&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;series&lt;/code&gt; properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://christt105.github.io/blog/media-tracker-obsidian/MediaTrackerSeasonObsidian.png"
	width="1496"

		alt="Season Note Example Obsidian"
	
	
		class="gallery-image" 
		data-flex-grow="146"
		data-flex-basis="351px"
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id="update-images"&gt;Update Images
&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using only the first image provided by TMDB or IGDB isn&amp;rsquo;t very customizable. I created &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/christt105/media-tracker-obsidian-template/blob/main/MediaTrackerTemplate%2FScripts%2FQuickAdd%2FupdateImages.js" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
 &gt;this script&lt;/a&gt; that shows different images so you can pick the one you prefer. It works for both covers and banners. If it&amp;rsquo;s a movie, it searches on &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.themoviedb.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
 &gt;TMDB&lt;/a&gt;; if it&amp;rsquo;s a game, it uses the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.steamgriddb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
 &gt;SteamGridDb&lt;/a&gt; API, as IGDB images are often low quality. The script first checks for a SteamGridDb ID; if not found, it searches by name and saves the ID for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://christt105.github.io/blog/media-tracker-obsidian/ObsidianUpdateCover.png"
	width="1910"

	loading="lazy"
	
		alt="ObsidianUpdateCover"

		alt="ObsidianUpdateBanner"
	
	
		class="gallery-image" 
		data-flex-grow="185"
		data-flex-basis="446px"
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id="steam-id"&gt;Steam ID
&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the games from my old Notion base, I needed to save the Steam ID to generate store links and show official artwork. I created &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/christt105/media-tracker-obsidian-template/blob/main/MediaTrackerTemplate/Scripts/QuickAdd/steam.js" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
 &gt;this script&lt;/a&gt; that searches the store and inserts the ID into the note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id="import-scripts"&gt;Import scripts
&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to import all these scripts directly, you can use the QuickAdd &amp;ldquo;import packages&amp;rdquo; tool with the file &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/christt105/media-tracker-obsidian-template/blob/main/MediaTrackerTemplate/QuickAdd%20Packages/quickadd-package.quickadd.json" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
 &gt;quickadd-package.quickadd.json&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="pretty-properties"&gt;Pretty Properties
&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link" href="obsidian://show-plugin?id=pretty-properties" &gt;Pretty Properties&lt;/a&gt; is a visual plugin I use to render covers and banners directly in each note&amp;rsquo;s properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="current-workflow"&gt;Current Workflow
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;My workflow is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Movies:&lt;/strong&gt; If I watch it on &lt;a class="link" href="https://jellyfin.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
 &gt;Jellyfin&lt;/a&gt;, a plugin automatically marks it as watched on &lt;a class="link" href="https://simkl.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
 &gt;Simkl&lt;/a&gt;. If it&amp;rsquo;s at the cinema, I add it to Simkl manually. Then, in Obsidian, I create the note, set the status to &amp;ldquo;Finished,&amp;rdquo; assign my personal rating, and write my thoughts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Series:&lt;/strong&gt; The workflow is the same, episode by episode. When I finish the season, I register it in Obsidian.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Games:&lt;/strong&gt; When I finish them, I add them and choose the images I like best.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusions"&gt;Conclusions
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With these tools, I have a very comfortable multimedia manager. Thanks to Obsidian and its scripts, I handle everything without leaving the app. The data are simple text files under my control, with automatic backups twice a day since they are in my personal vault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This solution has nothing to envy commercial tools. From the initial list, only one point is missing: the website to share it with friends. Thanks to Hugo and the fact that Obsidian uses Markdown, it has been very easy, but we&amp;rsquo;ll see that in the next post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you liked it. I&amp;rsquo;ve taken a while to publish it because I wanted to have the template ready in case anyone wants to use it. If it&amp;rsquo;s useful to you, I&amp;rsquo;d appreciate a reaction or a star on the repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you in the next post, where I&amp;rsquo;ll show how to create a site like &lt;a class="link" href="https://christt105.github.io/MediaTracker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
 &gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; with this data!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you next time!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>In Search of the Definitive Media Tracker: The Origins</title><link>https://christt105.github.io/blog/media-tracker-origins/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://christt105.github.io/blog/media-tracker-origins/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://christt105.github.io/" alt="Featured image of post In Search of the Definitive Media Tracker: The Origins" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello again. It&amp;rsquo;s been less time since the last post this time, and I hope this one is a bit shorter than the last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote a post about this topic, but it ended up being excessively long, so I&amp;rsquo;ve divided it into three parts. This will be the first post of the three, in which I will explain my experience keeping a log of the movies, series, and games I&amp;rsquo;ve watched and played. In the next two posts, I will explain the two new tools I use for my media tracking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="background"&gt;Background
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am a person who likes to know what I did and when I did it, but at the same time, I have a bad memory. On the other hand, I&amp;rsquo;ve never had much film culture. I watched movies within the norm, whatever was on TV and occasionally what was in the cinema. I watched almost no series; I remember watching &lt;em&gt;The Walking Dead&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Breaking Bad&lt;/em&gt;, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t finish either. Regarding games, things are different. Since I was little, I loved them and played quite a few. There was a time when I stopped playing, then I returned to them with much more moderation, started studying video game development, and now I make them. When I got older, I ended up getting a taste for movies and series; I started watching them differently. It also helped that it is now much easier to have access to any movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping control of what you watch and play is quite satisfying. It is information about yourself captured in a medium that allows you to see your tastes and cultural evolution. That is why I wanted to have a media tracker. The problem is that there is no solution available that meets all my needs. So, in this post, I will do a retrospective of my evolution using different tools to maintain a media registry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="twitter-and-tvtime"&gt;Twitter and TvTime
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It all started in 2022 when I realized that I hadn&amp;rsquo;t played anything so far that year, nor was I used to watching series or movies. I wanted to keep track of what I watched and played, so I started a Twitter thread with the games I was beating, and I used &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.tvtime.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
 &gt;TvTime&lt;/a&gt; to keep a record of movies and series. I beat several games in a row that month, but I put it aside. I was using TvTime to keep track of episodes, but sometimes I forgot to mark an episode as watched; I&amp;rsquo;m a bit of a mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2023, I started another thread for everything I played and watched that year. Now I was taking it more seriously. When I finished a game, a movie, or a series, I wrote a tweet with a comment and added images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I continued in 2024 with the same thing. I used TvTime to keep track of what I was watching so I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t forget which episode I was on and to have a perspective of what I was consuming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="stash-and-backloggd"&gt;Stash and Backloggd
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For movies and series, TvTime was fine, but for video games, I had a problem. I was considering several options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I found &lt;a class="link" href="https://stash.games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
 &gt;Stash&lt;/a&gt;, which is a mobile app for tracking video games. You can mark games as completed with the main story, main plus extras, or 100% completed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, I saw &lt;a class="link" href="https://backloggd.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
 &gt;Backloggd&lt;/a&gt; and investigated it. It is very similar to Stash but on the web. They had something on their roadmap that interested me a lot: the creation of an API. This way, I could read and modify data externally. They never ended up creating it and removed it from the roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="notion"&gt;Notion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the previously mentioned tools, I could track everything, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t own my data; I had no way to extract the data to put it into another tool if they were to discontinue it. Just in 2024, the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.notion.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
 &gt;Notion&lt;/a&gt; fever hit me. With this tool, I could create my own databases, and it occurred to me to keep the tracking there. The idea was to keep using Twitter as a social showcase and TvTime as an episodic tracker. The main problem with Twitter was that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t edit the tweet if there was a mistake; it&amp;rsquo;s very volatile information, and searching for something was becoming very complicated. TvTime just worked; it was missing some things like being able to see where my friends were in each series, but otherwise, it just worked for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, with Notion, I could generate a database where each item was a movie, series, or video game. I could edit any note at any time and publish it on the web. Later, they added the possibility of making charts to show statistics. Everything was very pretty, so I created a &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.notion.com/templates/media-tracker" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
 &gt;template&lt;/a&gt; and started migrating everything to Notion. I published &lt;a class="link" href="https://christt105.notion.site/media-tracker" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
 &gt;the website&lt;/a&gt; with Notion and kept using Twitter and TvTime as usual, tracking series in TvTime, and upon finishing a series, game, or movie, I published it on Twitter and added it to Notion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Notion, I had several sections where the items were shown. Each movie, series, or video game has several properties. The essentials are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cover (Image): usually the direct URL of the image from &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.themoviedb.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
 &gt;tmdb&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.thetvdb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
 &gt;thetvdb&lt;/a&gt;, or an uploaded image.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Type (Select): Movie, Series, or Video Game.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Status (Status): Not Started, In Progress, Paused, Abandoned, or Finished.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Completed (Date): Completion date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Release (Date): Release date, with the possibility of a notification to alert me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Properties (Multi-select): Different properties like the game platform, if I watched it in the cinema, if it is anime, or if I completed it 100%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time I wanted to add a new item, what I had to do was go to &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.themoviedb.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
 &gt;TMDB&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.thetvdb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
 &gt;TVDB&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.steamgriddb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
 &gt;SteamGridDB&lt;/a&gt;, search for the name, copy it, go back to Notion, create a new note, paste the name, go back to the web, search through the posters for the one I liked the most, copy the URL, go back to Notion, paste it in the cover section as a URL, and finally select the type of item it is. It&amp;rsquo;s not excessive work, but nothing comparable to the workflow I have achieved now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other properties like buttons that change the status and date or &amp;ldquo;recommended to people,&amp;rdquo; but they aren&amp;rsquo;t interesting. With all these properties, you can make a more than decent tracker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="the-website-with-notion"&gt;The website with Notion
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notion allows you to publish your notes to the web. I published the Media Tracker with Notion, and it generated this URL: &lt;a class="link" href="https://christt105.notion.site/media-tracker" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
 &gt;https://christt105.notion.site/media-tracker&lt;/a&gt;. The web is basically the Notion interface but without the ability to interact. You can&amp;rsquo;t change the style, so the covers remain very small, and the result leaves much to be desired.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="media-cover-recap"&gt;Media Cover Recap
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the end of 2024, I liked the idea of making a collage with all the covers of everything I had consumed that year, and I got to work on it. To solve that, Notion has an API that allowed me to grab information from my databases, and that&amp;rsquo;s how I made the &lt;a class="link" href="https://christt105.github.io/projects/mediacoverrecap/" &gt;Media Cover Recap&lt;/a&gt;, a web project in &lt;a class="link" href="https://godotengine.org/es/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
 &gt;Godot&lt;/a&gt; that generated collages from the Notion database. Obviously, Godot is not the best tool for that, but back then, I was very obsessed with Godot and wanted to try it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It worked decently, but the main problem was &lt;a class="link" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CORS" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
 &gt;CORS&lt;/a&gt;, which doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow HTTP requests from one service to another. So either I created a small server that redirected the requests, or I made it a desktop and mobile application. And that wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a good solution either because images with links can become unavailable or the Notion API can change, and it would stop working. So all the time I dedicated to this project was destined to go to waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having seen all this, I wanted something more, to give it a little push so that it would be perfect and I would feel comfortable with what I was using. The Notion solution was more than decent, but it had major drawbacks. Adding a new item was somewhat uncomfortable, I could only use it with an internet connection, navigating between items was tedious and didn&amp;rsquo;t allow for a perfect structure, the web was quite ugly and immutable, and the media cover recap was destined to disappear. Even if it was very unlikely, Notion could delete all my content if it wanted to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is why, and because I started using &lt;a class="link" href="https://Obsidian.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
 &gt;Obsidian&lt;/a&gt;, I decided to create a new solution for my Media Tracker, this time something more complex to configure but much more comfortable to use. I have achieved a tool that adapts perfectly to me. It is comfortable and has everything I need. But I will explain that in the next post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you later!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
