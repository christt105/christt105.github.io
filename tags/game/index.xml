This project was created over the course of three months as part of the subject “Project 3,” with the goal of simulating the workflow of a real indie studio. Developed entirely using our own custom engine, the team was divided into design, programming, and art departments, working together to bring a complete game experience to life. I focused on programming, rotating between gameplay and engine development throughout the project.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Final Fantasy: Mystery World</title><link>https://christt105.github.io/projects/finalfantasymysteryworld/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://christt105.github.io/projects/finalfantasymysteryworld/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://christt105.github.io/projects/finalfantasymysteryworld/FinalFantasyMysteryWorld.webp" alt="Featured image of post Final Fantasy: Mystery World" />&lt;p>Final Fantasy: Mystery World is a dungeon crawler RPG with micro-turn-based combat, where players follow the main story branch to rescue their kidnapped friend from the clutches of a mysterious monster in the Final Fantasy universe.

The game includes multiple levels, enemy waves, and basic power-up mechanics, aiming to replicate the fast-paced feel of early 90s arcade shooters.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Boxing AR</title><link>https://christt105.github.io/projects/boxingar/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://christt105.github.io/projects/boxingar/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://christt105.github.io/projects/boxingar/roboboxing.webp" alt="Featured image of post Boxing AR" />&lt;p>Control a boxing robot and achieve the RoboBoxing glory!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Empty Universe</title><link>https://christt105.github.io/projects/emptyuniverse/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://christt105.github.io/projects/emptyuniverse/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://christt105.github.io/projects/emptyuniverse/emptyuniverse.webp" alt="Featured image of post Empty Universe" />&lt;p>Empty Universe is an exhaustic adventure where you will have to defend the ship of enemies.
