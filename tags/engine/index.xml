Developed entirely using our own custom engine, the team was divided into design, programming, and art departments, working together to bring a complete game experience to life. I focused on programming, rotating between gameplay and engine development throughout the project.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Whisp Engine</title><link>https://christt105.github.io/projects/whispengine/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://christt105.github.io/projects/whispengine/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://christt105.github.io/projects/whispengine/WhispEngine.webp" alt="Featured image of post Whisp Engine" />&lt;p>Whisp Engine is a custom 3D game engine developed from scratch using OpenGL and SDL, featuring a basic Lua scripting system and a Unity-inspired entity-component architecture.
