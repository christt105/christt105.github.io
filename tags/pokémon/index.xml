It was developed using Python together with the tool thenewpoketext, which allows extraction, editing, and reinsertion of game text into the ROMs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For Following Platinum, the translation combines the original Spanish text from Pokémon Platinum with newly translated content introduced by the hack.
For Following Renegade Platinum, it builds upon Drakyem’s Spanish translation of Renegade Platinum, adding all the additional content from Following Platinum as well.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
