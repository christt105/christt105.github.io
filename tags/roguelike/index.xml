&lt;p>I took on the role of Team Lead, coordinating the team&amp;rsquo;s workflow, managing task distribution, and ensuring smooth collaboration. In addition to leading the team, I also contributed significantly as a core programmer, working on game systems, combat logic, and overall structure.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
